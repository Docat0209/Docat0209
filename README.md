## 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm Docat — a full-stack developer currently diving deep into AI-integrated tooling.

I didn’t grow up fluent in code. I stumbled into programming through a high school competition team, barely able to write a `for` loop. That accident turned into a long-term dive into system architecture, product design, and practical AI development.  
I later placed 3rd in Mobile Applications Development at Taiwan's 51st National Skills Competition — a turning point in my engineering journey.

I care about code that’s clean, logical, and easy to navigate — not for aesthetics, but because clarity is survival. I tend to work from the inside out: understanding the logic first, then structuring outward with intention.

Right now, I’m focused on building tools that bridge LLMs with full-stack applications in ways that feel natural and purposeful. My long-term goal is to build systems that think clearly, respond intelligently, and stay maintainable under pressure.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

### 📱 E-Scooter Rental App  
**Role:** Team lead, system designer, Android + backend developer  
Led a 10-member student team to deliver a complete mobile + backend rental platform within 2 months.  
Designed custom UI, implemented user role verification, and handled location sync via Spring Boot + MySQL.

### 💼 Logistics Report System (Freelance, NDA)  
**Role:** Full system developer  
Developed a Windows application for generating internal freight reports.  
Built custom UI with C# WinForms, implemented role-based views, and integrated business logic into multi-step workflows.

### 🧾 POS System with Printer Integration (Freelance, NDA)  
**Role:** Frontend/backend integrator using Django  
Delivered a Django-based POS interface with printing support.  
Focused on admin-side operations, user flow testing, and API-template synchronization under business constraints.

### 🛠 Lohasnet App Maintenance (Part-Time Developer)  
**Role:** Android, iOS & Flutter maintenance engineer  
Maintained and updated multiple production apps. Tasks included UI fixes, SDK upgrades, release management, and minor feature patches.  
Worked with legacy code, IoT packet issues, and commercial QA standards.  
Android was not new to me — I had already built full-featured apps during my skills competition days.

## 🧠 Skills Overview

I mostly work across full-stack systems and AI-integrated tools. Here's how I describe my practical experience in each area:

### 💻 Platforms & Native Development

Android is my strongest platform. I started with it during competitive training, and later built multiple production-level apps using Kotlin and Java. I’m familiar with MVC architecture, custom views, and the Play Store release process.

At Lohasnet(樂活資訊服務股份有限公司), I helped maintain Flutter and iOS projects in production environments, working on bug fixes and SDK-level integration.

I also have hands-on experience with C# WinForms, having built internal reporting tools with role-based access and panel-driven UIs.

### 🔙 Backend & System Design

I've built systems using Spring Boot and Django, including authentication flows, user role control, and data APIs.  
For database work, I’ve used both SQL and ORM depending on the needs of the project, and I'm comfortable managing the full data pipeline from frontend input to persistent storage.

### 🤖 AI Systems & LLM Applications

I have a solid understanding of how transformers, attention, embeddings, and fusion strategies work. I can clearly distinguish the tradeoffs between fine-tuning and prompt engineering.

On the implementation side, I’ve built basic RAG-style pipelines using FAISS as the vector database.  
I’ve also deployed local models and trained classical ML models like LSTM, CNN, and KNN.  
Right now, I’m most interested in designing LLM tools that are more context-aware, purposeful, and actually helpful in real-world workflows.

### ⚙️ Tooling & Dev Practices

I use Git routinely for version control and follow structured workflows with `main`, `dev`, and `feature-*` branches.  
Postman is my go-to for API testing, and I use logging where needed to track backend events.
